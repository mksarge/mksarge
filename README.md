### About

React Static Boilerplate was used as a template for this site. 

> [**React Static Boilerplate**](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate) (RSB) is an
> opinionated boilerplate and tooling for creating modern stand-alone web applications (aka
> [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)s) for a serverless architecture. RSB
> significantly reduces cost by eliminating the need for servers such as EC2 instances because the
> entire site can be hosted directly from CDN ([Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), [GitHub
> Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Amazon S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html),
> or other similar cloud storage). Sites built with RSB can be fully functional with REST API or
> GraphQL calls to micro-services such as [Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/),
> [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/), or dynamic Docker endpoints
> hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=eef302dbae9f&utm_source=github&utm_medium=oss_sponsorships&utm_campaign=opencollective).
> RSB demonstrates how to use component-based UI development approach with best of breed
> technologies including [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/),
> [Babel](http://babeljs.io/), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/),
> [React Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/) and more.

I removed the integration with Material Design Lite and inserted my own custom css, which
includes a colour scheme inspired by [One Dark UI](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui) theme for Atom text editor.
