### [KiCASS]()
#### Kinect-Controlled Artistic Sensing System

<br>

KiCASS is a system that uses the Microsoft Kinect v2 for PC to perform skeletal tracking of a performer (dancer, musician, etc.)
It then packages and sends requested positional data as OSC messages to machines running MaxMSP, for further audio manipulation.

<br>

It was developed as a final year project by a team of UBC ECE students, in collaboration with the UBC Laptop Orchestra (also known as UBC IMPART), with the goal of adding the new Kinect sensor to the list of available motion capture technologies used by IMPART to create interactive audio-art installations/performances.
