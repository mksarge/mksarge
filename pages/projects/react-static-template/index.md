### Overview

#### Description

React Static Template is a boilerplate for React apps that has a simple one-page layout
(no routing), markdown compatibility, and plays well with GitHub pages.

<br>

#### React Static Boilerplate

[React Static Boilerplate][rst] is a similar and more fully featured project that includes
routing and many other features. I learned a lot from its code, and eventually integrated
some of its features into this project. 

<br>

#### Demo

### Motivation

#### Learning React

I made the first version of React Static Template when I first started learning and using
React. Since then, I've added more features as I became more familiar with React and its
ecosystem.

### Deploy

#### GitHub Pages

React Static Template is a great choice for a simple React-based project landing page served
with GitHub Pages.

<br>

Simply build the project and push the newly-generated files from the `public` folder into root
directory of the `gh-pages` branch.

<br>

Note that GitHub Pages has trouble resolving relative links, so you may have to append a
dot in front of any relative links in `index.html`.
