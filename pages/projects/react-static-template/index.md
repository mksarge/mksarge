markdown compatibility, and plays well with GitHub pages._

### Motivation

#### Learning React

I made the first version of React Static Template when I first started learning and using
React. Since then, I've added more features as I became more familiar with React and its
ecosystem.

#### React Static Boilerplate

[React Static Boilerplate][rst] is a similar and more fully featured project that includes
routing and many other features. I adapted it to build this site, learned a lot from
its code, and eventually integrated some of its features into React Static Template.

### Description

#### Features

React Static Template.

#### Use Cases

RST works well

#### GitHub Pages

React Static Boilerplate is a great choice for a simple React-based project landing page served
with GitHub Pages. To do this, simply build the project with `npm run build`, then commit and
push the files from `public` into a new branch: `gh-pages`. Finally, configure GitHub Pages in
the GitHub settings.

Warning: GitHub Pages seems to have trouble with relative links, so you may have to append a
dot `.` to the start of any relative links in `index.html`.
