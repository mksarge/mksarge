# Fine Scrubbing

## iOS-style "fine scrubbing" for html video

<hr>

### Background

Audio and video players are ubiquitous on the internet. From YouTube to Vimeo, Netflix and
more, we're all familiar with the basic controls available to most players: play and pause
buttons, a progress bar, volume controls, a fullscreen button, etc.

<br>

In this project, I will focus on the progress bar control. Now, there have been innovations
in other video controls such as @@@@ and video overlays, but there has not been much
innovation in modern implementations of video player scroll bars, with one exception:
Apple iOS audio/video players.

<hr>

### Problem

Accessible design means.

<br>

When it comes to "scrubbing" - the act of scolling the audio/video progress bars forward or back,
the consideration of accessible design can be a huge deal.

<br>

The most thoughtful example I've come across is in Apple's "fine scrubbing" design for iOS devices.
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slEYBlw6pCs) is a demo of that feature, implemented in the
default music application.

<br>

iOS fine scrubbing is a modern and well-designed solution for the accessibility problem discussed
above, and I view it a tragedy that no similar or inspired designs can be found on other popular
platforms!

### Solution

I aim to

- develop a working demo, implementing iOS-style fine scrubbing to html video  

- implement iOS-style "fine scrubbing" on html video, with initial focus on desktop/mouse

- research/create different designs for different scenarios (phone/tablet/desktop; touchscreen/touchpad/mouse)
