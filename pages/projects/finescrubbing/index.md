### [Fine Scrubbing]()
#### iOS-style "fine scrubbing" for desktop video

<br> 

Web-based video players are a ubiquitous interface that internet users face almost every day. From YouTube to Vimeo, Netflix and more, we are all familiar with the basic controls available to most players: play, pause, progress bar, volume controls, fullscreen, etc.

<br> 

However, there haven't been many notable improvements in implementations of modern video players, with the shining exception of Apple's "fine scrubbing" paradigm (demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slEYBlw6pCs) on iOS devices. iOS fine scrubbing is a very well-received and modern design solution that is well suited for most iOS audio/video applications. I view it a tragedy that this idea has not caught on with other platforms (Android/desktop/web) as of 2016!

<br> 

This project aims to: 
-implement iOS-style "fine scrubbing" on html video, with initial focus on desktop/mouse
-research/create different designs for different scenarios (phone/tablet/desktop; touchscreen/touchpad/mouse)
