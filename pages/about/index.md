# ABOUT

<hr>

#### Michael

I'm Michael, a web developer and new grad from the Computer Engineering program at the
[University of British Columbia][ubc]. I'm currently working as an academic
assistant under UBC professor Reid Holmes, building [ClassPortal][classportal].

<br>

#### Goals

I'm interested in furthering my skills as a
JavaScript developer and becoming a strong full-stack engineer. My academic interests
include topics in [human-computer interaction](/projects/kicass) and
[accessibility in UI design](/projects/finescrubbing).

<br>

#### Site

This static site was built with React, with help from [React Static Boilerplate][boiler],
and the design was inspired by the [One Dark UI][onedark] theme for Atom text editor.
The [source code][source] is on GitHub.
