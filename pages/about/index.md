# ABOUT

<hr>

#### Michael

I'm Michael, a web developer and computer engineering undergrad at the
[University of British Columbia][ubc]. I'm interested in furthering my skills as a
JavaScript engineer and becoming a strong full-stack engineer. My academic interests
include topics in human-computer interaction and acessibility in the context of UI design.

#### Website

This static site was built with React, with help from [React Static Boilerplate][boiler],
and the design was inspired by the [One Dark UI][onedark] theme for Atom text editor.
The source code can be found on [GitHub][source].
