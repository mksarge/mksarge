# ABOUT

<hr>

#### Michael

I'm Michael, a web developer and new graduate of the Computer Engineering program at the
University of British Columbia. I'm currently working as an academic
assistant under UBC professor Reid Holmes, building [ClassPortal][/projects/classportal].

<br>

#### Goals

I'm interested in furthering my skills as a
JavaScript developer and becoming a strong full-stack engineer. My academic interests
include topics in [human-computer interaction](/projects/kicass) and
[accessibility in UI design](/projects/finescrubbing).

#### Site

This site was built with help from [React Static Boilerplate][boiler], and the design was
inspired by the [One Dark][onedark] theme for the Atom editor. The source code can be found
on [GitHub][source].
